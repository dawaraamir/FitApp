      <h2>Dawar Aamir</h2>
      <p class="role">Founder &amp; Head Coach</p>
      <p>Dawar spent years as an in-person trainer listening to clients describe the same struggle: “I know what to do, I just can’t stay consistent.” By blending that on-the-floor experience with product design, Dawar Power was born—an assistant that fits into your life instead of demanding you rebuild it.</p>
